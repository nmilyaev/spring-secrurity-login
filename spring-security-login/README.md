# Getting Started

## About

Spring-security based login application, based on 
[Spring Security Form Login by Baeldung](https://www.baeldung.com/spring-security-login) and (mostly) https://spring.io/guides/gs/securing-web/
Later version is based on https://spring.io/guides/gs/securing-web/

### So far implemented:
 * Simple no-password page (greetings.html) - uses spring thymeleaf for a template
 * A set of password-protected end points (see SecSecurityConfig.java for details)
